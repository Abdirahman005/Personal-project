      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am <strong>Fathi Mohamed</strong>, a Full Stack Software Engineer with hands-on experience designing and developing modern web applications across both frontend and backend systems, with a focus on building reliable and scalable solutions that deliver efficient, user-centered experiences. My frontend expertise includes <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</strong>, which I use to create responsive, performance-driven, and visually refined interfaces with strong attention to usability and clean component architecture. On the backend, I work with <strong>Node.js, Express, Python, Flask, and MySQL</strong> to develop secure, well-structured APIs and backend services, including data modeling and server-side workflows that support robust application functionality. I am adaptable, detail-oriented, and proactive in learning new technologies, able to collaborate effectively within teams as well as work independently, and I take pride in writing maintainable, well-documented code while consistently delivering solutions that meet both technical and business requirements.
